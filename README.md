Leveraging the nature of autonomous world, we can incrementally let players redefine the rules they want to use while brainstroming a topic creating an open-ended, collaborative knowledge commons.

Interobjective realities: Human society relies on a shared understanding of common concepts that are accepted as part of our worlds reality. Examples of such concepts are money, nations, etc. All this concepts have the burden of some fuzzi-ness.

Create some world objects and behavior where competing properties of inter-subjective realities combine to something positive-sum. 

Turn fuzziness to fizziness.
